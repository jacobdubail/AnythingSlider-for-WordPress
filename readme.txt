== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I use this plugin? =

It's easy! Create a few slides using the Slides custom post type. Then, on a post or page of your choosing, use the [anything_slides] shortcode to embed the slideshow.

= How do I display one category, specifically, in my slideshow? =

There are a variety of options you can add to the [anything_slides] shortcode:

* cat *the category slug of your desired category*
* width or height *the width or height of the slideshow - this overrides the global settings*
* delay *the time between slides*
* resume *time between user interaction and slideshow resume*
* animation *how long the slide animation lasts*

= How can I add this to a theme file? =

Easy. Just use the standard method of embedding shortcodes into theme files: `<?php echo do_shortcode( "[anything_slides]" ); ?>`

For more information about the jQuery plugin, visit <a href="http://proloser.github.com/AnythingSlider/" target="_blank">this GitHub repo</a>.

= How do I customize the CSS for my slideshows? =

Simply add the file 'anythingslider.css' to your theme directory, or your theme's CSS directory.  That's it. The plugin will detect the file's existence and do the heavy lifting for you.

= How do I use the new Navigation Formatter feature =

You'll notice on the Slides post/page there is a new metabox for Navigation Formatter.  Add the text you'd like to use into this box.

Next add the new attribute to the shortcode wherever you'd like to use custom navigation formatting.

The shortcode has a new attribute `navFormat`.  The existence of this attribute in your shortcode call will grab the text you just entered and use that for the navigation title.
